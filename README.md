# Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
The Weather Prediction Project is designed to forecast weather conditions based on historical weather data using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes various data science techniques and tools to analyze and predict future weather patterns.

## Features
- Data collection from multiple weather data sources.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Implementation of machine learning models for weather prediction.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance.
- Deployment of the model for real-time weather forecasting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, requests

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
    cd weather-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data and models.

## Usage
1. Data Collection:
    - Use the `data_collection.py` script to fetch historical weather data from the specified APIs.
    ```bash
    python data_collection.py
    ```

2. Data Preprocessing:
    - Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and preprocess the collected data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Explore the dataset using the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

4. Model Training:
    - Train the machine learning models using the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

5. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the performance of the trained models using the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

6. Deployment:
    - Deploy the trained model for real-time prediction using the `deployment.py` script.
